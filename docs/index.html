<h1>Achieving a regular flow of data between main() and an interrupt service routine using a lock-free circular queue with a producer-consumer design pattern</h1>

<p><a href="producer_consumer.pdf">This article</a> aims to illustrate how to take data that might not be
produced at a regular interval by a routine inside main(), and smooth
out the consumption of that data by an ISR, so it may be consumed at a
regular interval using a lock-free circular queue.</p>

<p>It also demonstrates how to design a lock-free data structure that
can safely pass an arbitrary sized piece of data to an interrupt
service routine, without having to disable interrupts (or use an
ATOMIC_BLOCK).</p>

<p>The sample code was written using AVR-GCC for an AVR ATmega328P,
but it can be easily modified to work with other compilers and/or
chips.</p>

<p>The concepts presented in this article were originally developed
for my <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/artcfox/rainbow-fire">Rainbow Fire</a> project, but are
  applicable to a wide range of solutions.</p>

<p>The project described in the article
is available in a <a href="https://github.com/artcfox/producer-consumer">git repository</a>.</p>
